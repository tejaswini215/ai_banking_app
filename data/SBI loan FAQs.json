Thus, you continue to pay interest on a certain portion of the principal that you have actually paid back to the lender. This means that the EMI for the monthly reducing system is effectively less than the annual reducing system.     Monthly reducing method:In this system, the principal, for which you pay interest, reduces every month as you pay your EMI.     Daily Reducing method:In this system, the principal, for which you pay interest, reduces from the day you pay your EMI. EMI in the daily reducing system is less than in the monthly reducing system and a year is treated as consisting of 365 days irrespective of leap or non-leap year.",

    "question": "How do I benefit if the interest is calculated on a daily reducing balance for SBI Home Loans?",
    "answer": " On an annual reducing balance method, you will continue to pay interest on amounts you repay during the coming one year as the interest for the year is determined on the basis of the balance outstanding at the beginning of the year. In the case of the daily reducing balance, which is the methodology we employ, your interest is calculated only on the outstanding loan amount, which reduces every time you pay off your EMIs or make any prepayments. This in essence lowers your effective rate of interest significantly.",
